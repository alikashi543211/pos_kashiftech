I have worked in bitsoftsol company. I worked in Laravel Administration . I converted this laravel
administration into Laravel package, I made a command to download package uploaded on laravel
packages list. I built in Laravel Administration to Automate crud, I resolved the issue for
developers to save time to make cruds , Developer only will create model and migration and will
use LaravelAdminTrait then autometically crud will be performed including web and api routes
and views, Developer do not need to define controller functions, web and api routes for crud
User can define Modal migration fields from front view of laravel administration interface.This
Laravel Administration package is Like Django Autometic Admin Panel idea i built Laravel
Administration in PHP , Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery.

I build a web application MyPropertyOffer. The idea was to convert the client excel Business

into software make a library for formulas all formulas of client excel sheet. and calculate
the final result at the end of all inputs
